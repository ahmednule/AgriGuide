          AgriGuide uses AI image recognition to help African farmers identify
          and manage crop pests and diseases accurately and efficiently. Farmers
          upload pictures of their crops showing potential issues, and the AI
          analyzes the images to identify the specific pest or disease,
          providing targeted treatment recommendations.
